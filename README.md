# Mozilla-Automatic-Bug-Triaging
Predict the software component to which the bug should belong to, given the past data about bugs and the components to which they were associated.

### Approach:
* Straightforward multiclass classification using Deep Learning.
* Used multiple pre-trained embeddings and slightly different networks.
* Did 10-fold stratified cross validation on each model, a modelâ€™s predictions are itself mean of predictions of all 10 folds.
* Took weighted average of all the model predictions.

### Neural network layers:
* Bidirectional GRU layers.
* Attention layer.
* Dense layers.
* Dropouts.
All the models were combination of these layers.

### Pre-trained embeddings:
* Fasttext common crawl.
* Glove common crawl.
* Fasttext common crawl on subwords.
* Fasttext wiki pretrained.

### Input to neural networks:
* I used only the bug description (short+long) as input to the models.
* Tried using other features too but it worsened the results.
* Tried giving weights to the classes to avoid class imbalance but it also worsened the results
